The solution was created in Google Colab

In order to run the .ipynb file, one can simply double click the file and run it locally using Jupyter Notebook or upload it to drive and run it on Google Colab. This can work on any OS.

The following libraries should be installed if run locally - 
Sklearn
Pandas
numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib

The path for the train and test files are given so as to run it without any hindrance. If the file doesnâ€™t run then the path will need to be changed accordingly.
